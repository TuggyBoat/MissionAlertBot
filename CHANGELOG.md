## 2.4.1
- Fixed reference to `;stock` in mission embed


## 2.4.0
Integrated stock tracking features from stockbot (with thanks to DudeInCorner and Durzo):
- `/stock`:
 - can be used in a carrier channel without parameters to check stock of that carrier.
 - can be used with carrier as a parameter to check stock for any carrier.
 - can optionally specify inara or capi as source; default is capi.
 - added information in footer as to stock source.
 - EDMC data notice is now context-sensitive:
   - EDMC notice will only show when source is 'inara'.
   - EDMC-off missions will show a reminder to disable EDMC, instead of the reminder to use it
- `/cco capi enable`: If capi auth is confirmed, will flag the carrier(s) as capi-enabled; otherwise, will send the target carrier owner a DM with OAuth link and explanation. Multiple carriers can be separated by commas.
- `/cco capi disable`: Will flag the carrier(s) as capi-disabled and prevent capi stock checks. Multiple carriers can be separated by commas.
- Adding carriers to Mission Alert Bot will no longer prompt the user to add to stockbot.

Integrated WMM tracking features from stockbot (with thanks to Durzo):
- WMM stock display in #wmm-stock and #cco-wmm-supplies.
- `/cco wmm enable`: Adds a carrier to WMM tracking; option to autocomplete station location from list.
- `/cco wmm disable`: Removes one or more carriers from WMM tracking. Multiple carriers can be separated by commas.
- `/cco wmm update`: Trigger manual refresh of all WMM stock.
- `/admin wmm status`: Check the status of the WMM background task; now shows time remaining until next loop, as well as current interval time.
- `/admin wmm stop`: Stop the WMM background task.
- `/admin wmm start`: Start or restart the WMM background task.
- `/admin wmm interval`: Set the WMM update interval in minutes.
- `m.wmm_list`: List active WMM carriers.

Other:
- `/carrier add` and `Add Carrier` no longer offer StockBot code for `;add_FC`.
- `/carrier add` no longer has a shortname field; all shortnames are now generated internally by MAB.
- `/carrier add` can now be used in #CCO-general-chat
- Changed references to `;stock <shortname>` to `/stock`.
- Removed shortname as a user-facing variable.
- Added cAPI status to carrier info embeds.
- Trade Alerts will now include updated supply/demand remaining if a user uses `/stock` for a carrier on a mission.
- Updated web links for loading/unloading images so Discord will finally stock mocking me with cached images from 3 months ago.
- `/admin capi_sync`: Intended for first run after StockBot migration: updates CAPI status for all registered PTN Fleet Carriers.
- Added initial `settings.txt` with option to disable WMM auto start and specific some command IDs; for now, only `/stock` is implemented:
 - `/admin settings view` to view settings.txt;
 - `/admin settings change` to change a setting in the file.

## 2.1.0

Refactoring:

- Split `MissionGenerator.py` into `MissionGenerator.py` and `MissonCleaner.py`
- Major changes to the internal structure of the mission generator
    - Misison generation is now more resilient to errors and communicates better when something goes wrong
- Added `Commodities.py` in preparation for adding a method to build the Commodities database from scratch
- Added custom errors for interaction role and channel checks, and called them via the global error handler
- More errors handled elegantly
- More helpful notifications to bot-spam
- Many bot-spam messages converted to embeds
- Many response messages converted to embeds
- Many small changes here and there

Removed commands:
- `loadlegacy`, `unloadlegacy` have been removed
- legacy support has been removed
- `loadrp`, `unloadrp` have been removed

Changed commands:
- `load` and `unload` are now `/cco load` and `/cco unload` respectively
    - added describes to all parameters
    - added autocomplete for common commodities and pad size
    - ETA and RP text have been merged into the new "Message" feature:
        - "Message" is entered via Modal and sent to Discord destinations in a separate embed
    - buttons or select menu options for sends, replacing chat letter entry
        - note **you can SCROLL the select menu** to reveal additional options
    - added icons for send status embeds
    - completely new embed format for Discord
    - added ability to send via webhook
    - tweaks to Reddit format
    - demand/supply is now entered as an int/float (i.e. without the "k"), and is subject to validation
- `done` is now `/cco complete`. `/cco done` remains as an alias, for now
    - `/cco complete` now has optional parameters for whether the mission was `Completed` or `Failed`, with autocomplete, as well as for an explanation message
        - by default, status is assumed to be `Completed`
    - many small changes to how `/cco complete` reports
- `carrier_image` is now `/cco image`
- `m.complete` is now `/mission complete`
    - no more option to add a message as an argument
    - button menu asks user whether mission completed or cannot be completed
    - clicking unable to complete prompts user for an explanation message
- `/mission` is now `/mission information`
- `m.unlock_override` deletion check temporarily disabled.

New commands:
- `/cco webhook add` - CCO only - used to add a webhook to that CCO's personal list
- `/cco webhook view` - CCO only - shows their webhooks
- `/cco webhook delete` - CCO only - used to remove a webhook from their list
- `/cco edit` - CCO only - used to edit an in-progress mission. Presently only the original interaction parameters can be edited (i.e. the fields added via slash command). Editing message and mission type will be implemented in a future update.
- `/admin_delete_mission` - Admin only - used to manually remove a mission from the database (without cleanup). Intended for unresolvable error situations only.
- added **training mode** to `/cco load` and `/cco unload`. This will not affect webhooks but will send discord alerts to the new training channels, and reddit posts to the testing subreddit. Webhooks will be sent as normal, but it's expected trainees will add a training webhook anyway.

Other:
- When channel deletion is in its final 10 second countdown, a notice will appear in the mission-generator to warn that deletion is in progress and the channel lock is acquired. It is strongly advised not to attempt to "send" missions during this brief window. The message is removed once the lock is released.
- Automatically update PTN logos used by the bot during June.


## 2.0.0

Refactoring:

- Refactored the bot into standardised directory structure
- Refactored commands into Cogs
- Refactored auxiliary functions into modules
- New global error handlers for interactions and text commands respectively
- Implemented setup.py, the bot is now installed via `pip install -e.`
- Cleaned up requirements
- Removed interaction sync listener, replaced with command
    - sync is a high intensity action, best practice is to only do it when needed
- Added persistant data directory for use when containerised
    - this contains all carrier images, carrier backup images, and community channel images, as well as all database, database dump, and database backups
- Many small improvements to code
- Many, many more improvements to do

New environment variables:

- `PTN_MAB_DATA_DIR` - specifies the path to the `/data` directory where the bot stores all mutable files (databases, carrier images, community channel thumbnails)
- `PTN_MAB_RESOURCE_DIR` - specifies the path to the `/resource` directory which houses static non-Python files (default carrier images, mission template images, edmc off images, and fonts)

New commands:

- `/greet` - functionally identical to m.ping but as a slash command
- `m.sync` - syncs interactions with the server
    - this has to be done any time an interaction is added, removed, or has its definition changed

Changed commands

- `nom_count` is now `/cp_nominees_list`, and is ephemeral with the option to broadcast to channel
- `nom_delete` is now `/cp_delete_nominee_from_database`, and uses button confirmations
- `nom_details` is now `/cp_nomination_details`, and is ephemeral with the option to broadcast to channel
- `carrier_add` is now `/carrier_add`
- `carrier_delete` is now `/carrier_delete`, and uses button confirmations
- many slash commands have had descriptions added to their parameters
- mission generator returnflag has been (temporarily) removed, making error recovery less graceful (but still robust)
- some commands which usually take a while now have a "MissionAlertBot is typing..." status
    - this is in the experimental stages and needs to be properly tweaked
